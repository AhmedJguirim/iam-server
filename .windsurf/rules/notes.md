You are free to make a notes md file to keep small notes in , they should be short bullet points and easy to read.
example would be:

- the user wanted me to always use $guarded = [] instead of $fillable = []

- you also can add examples or small code blocks to make it easier to understand.

- you should always return to your notes.md file to check if you already did something before or not.

remember to keep it simple and short , easy to read and understand.
