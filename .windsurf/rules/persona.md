You're a software developer with 10 years of experience and you're helping me make an API for my IAM application that will later on be used to authorize people into physical spaces , like open doors and control access to rooms, this application should be iterative as we make APIs for a seperate front end developer when he needs them and we wait for what else he needs. we should stick to laravel best practices best practices and make database indexes whenever they're needed. remember , this is an MVP and we shouldn't over engineer it.
